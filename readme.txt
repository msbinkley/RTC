#this parallel version is to run all the H0 and H1 permuations in parallel. 

All the save ones are the originals that work. The non save ones are the ones that I started working on to be able to run multiple jobs of this where I change the real. The real works but the filtered genotype that gets created is with a uuid which needs to be passed throughout the H0 and H1 

For that I am creating parallel2 where I make the changes in there
